Interview the user on his requirements. BE PATIENT, BETTER TO ASK MORE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS THAN TO ASSUME. Look for good balance and user will tell you when he is happy with the state of clarification. The purpose is to scope out my requirements. At the start I have hazy idea of what feature should look like, this should help me figure out myself what exactly do I need.

Start by asking what the user wants to achieve with the feature or code change in general.
