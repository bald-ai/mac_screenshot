- Switched text overlay to a resizable textarea that auto-grows to content while still supporting manual resizing.
- Added multiline text support with Shift+Enter, including updated measurement, selection box, hit testing, and save rendering.
- Removed the unused `editor-lean.html` file so only the in-app editor remains.
- Made the settings window draggable by starting a window drag from non-interactive areas of the panel.
- Tightened the note prefix toggle so only the checkbox itself toggles (text no longer clicks).
- Added configurable global screenshot shortcuts with parsing/validation, persistence, and tray label updates, plus a dedicated shortcut-config window UI.
- Updated the settings UI to show/edit shortcuts inline, handle duplicate errors, and include the new shortcut-config build entry.
- Rebranded “Light” as “Grey” across settings/rename/shortcut UI with refreshed gradients and migrated stored theme values.
- Refined filename template UI (preview layout, reset button copy, spacing/size adjustments) and small settings tweaks like slider stepping.
- Added new docs for shortcut planning/interview notes and added the shortcut-config window + drag permission to app capabilities.
- Ignored `NAs_dump.md` in git to avoid accidental staging of scratch dumps.
- Removed the Cmd+Shift+F global shortcut registration and handler.
- Disabled global shortcut handling while the shortcut-config popup is open, and normalized shortcut strings using a shared formatter across backend and UI.
- Expanded shortcut support to include punctuation keys (e.g., brackets, semicolon, quote, comma, period, slash, minus, equals).
